{% block head_blurb %}This is where we would a nice blurb about what RAD is, who 
            should use it, and what they might use it for. Also, this is a good 
            spot for a short version of our mission statement!{% endblock %}

<h3>Current Projects</h3>
<h5>RAD (Referral Aggregator Database)</h5>
<p>RAD is a comprehensive and nationally-collaborative database currently in development that uses the referral lists of trusted community organizations and the detailed reviews of folks like you so we all get better care.</p>
<h5>Social Media Compaigns</h5>
<p>From #selfcaresunday to #sexysaturday, we provide tips and resources for all aspects of the community and for your whole life. Follow us and have a RAD week!</p> 


<h3>Coming Soon</h3>
<h5>Know Your Rights Guides</h5>
<p>We will provide programming and printable materials around folks’ rights and responsibilities in various settings (medical environments both urgent and non-urgent, police and court situations, and housing –just to name a few).</p>
<h5>Translation Project</h5>
<p>We will have the site, database, and materials translated into as many languages as possible.</p> 
<h5>RAD Certified</h5>
<p>We will have providers of various sorts provide evidence of continuing education they’ve completed on topics related to our community, and in turn, we provide a special badge for them on the database and optimized search results for you.</p> 
<h5>Remedy on Demand</h5>
<p>We will provide consulting services for providers of all kinds, examining systems, processes, and intake forms and making things easier for trans, gender non-conforming, intersex, and queer people to navigate.</p>
