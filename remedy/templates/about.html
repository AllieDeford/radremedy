    <h3>History</h3> 
    <p>RAD Remedy got its start during <a href="http://www.transhack.org/">Trans*H4ck</a> Chicago in March 2014. Through the collaborative processes that happen at hackathons, Eliot, Rachel, and Riley honed our initial idea in conversation with other attendees, and presented our wireframe and minimal viable product. The judges awarded our project with the top honors of the hack, resulting in $500 in seed money through Amazon Web Services. We determined that the best way forward would be by engaging in a needs assessment survey of both individuals and organizations, so we would know the needs and desires of many folks within our community and could build a tool that serves folks well. </p>

    <p>We presented at TransOhio and exhibited at Philly Trans Health Conference, meeting folks, sharing stories, and collecting many survey responses along the way. Since then, we’ve had many more responses via our web-based version of the survey, providing a clear understanding of what many folks need and how we can best go forward. Through these experiences, we also gained additional team members Allie, Cate, and Dan, and the current RAD Remedy collective was born.</p>

    <p>On January 1, 2015, we seated our first-ever board of directors, with members hailing from many locations across the United States. Shortly thereafter, Andrea Zekis and Chef Fresh Roberson were selected by the board as Co-Chairs. In addition, we gained an additional twenty volunteers dedicated to data maintenance and curation.</p>

    <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
    <p>
        In a short time, RAD Remedy will develop RAD (Referral Aggregator Database), 
        a comprehensive and nationally-collaborative database that uses the 
        referral lists of trusted community organizations and 
        the detailed reviews of folks like you.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we plan on unveiling a feature known as &quot;RAD Certified&quot;
        where providers provide evidence of continuing education they've completed 
        on topics related to our community, and in turn, we provide a special badge 
        for them on the site and optimized search results for you.                  
    </p>    
    <p>
        Other future plans include talking with the community about our rights 
        in various environments and situations, translation of our site and database 
        into as many languages as possible, and consulting services for providers' 
        intake forms and other systems.
    </p>
    <p>
